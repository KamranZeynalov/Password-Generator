This was one of my first desktop GUI apps — a simple password generator built using **Python 3.6** and **Tkinter**

The app generates secure passwords based on user preferences:
- Only letters (uppercase + lowercase)
- Only numbers
- Letters + numbers
- Letters + numbers + symbols

> ⚠️ This project is not actively maintained. It's part of my early journey as a developer and is kept for nostalgia and reference.
